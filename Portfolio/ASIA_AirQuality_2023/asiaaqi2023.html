				Air pollution in the Asia region is a major health risk which also has

				While Asia is known for its at times problematic air quality, pollution
				levels still vary widely across the continent and there are also a few
				positive examples. The graph illustrates the average Air Quality Index
				(AQI) of each reported country during 12 months of the year. The color
				scale represents different levels of air quality, ranging from "good"
				(0-12), "moderate" (12.1-35.4), "unhealthy" (35.5-55.4), to "severe
				health risk" (55.5+).
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				In the comprehensive survey encompassing 36 Asian countries and regional
				economies, the findings reveal a prevailing trend: the majority fall
				under the category of moderate air quality. Specifically, 25 nations
				exhibit moderate air quality, while 10 contend with severe air
				conditions. Remarkably, only one nation boasts good air quality,
				underscoring the concerning state of air pollution across the region.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				Indeed, Japan attained the highest air quality index ratings, while
				Taiwan and Singapore narrowly missed this label by less 2.5 micrograms
				per cubic meter. The Philippines and Hong Kong SAR both experienced
				PM2.5 level below 17 milligrams, securing positions in the top 5
				cleanest air rankings in Asia.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				On the other hand, Bangladesh ranked first among 36 countries in the
				Asian region for having the poorest air quality. Pakistan and India were
				closely behind in the rankings. The report emphasized that South Asia
				faces the most severe pollution worldwide. Bangladesh's PM2.5 levels
				stand at 80.23 micrograms per cubic metre, nearly 16 times higher than
				the WHO recommends. Pakistan scored 57.17 while India's air had 47.49
				micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre on average over the last
				year.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				In summary, the survey across 36 Asian countries and regional economies
				in 2023 reveals widespread moderate to severe air quality issues
				throughout the region. Japan stands out for its good air quality index
				ratings, while Bangladesh leads with the poorest air quality, closely
				followed by Pakistan and India. This underscores the urgent need for
				immediate measures to address severe pollution, particularly in Asia's
				southern region.
