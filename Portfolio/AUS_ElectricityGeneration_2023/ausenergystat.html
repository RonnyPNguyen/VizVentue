				A break down of Australia's total electricity generation reveals a shift
				toward renewable energy sources. While Australia's total electricity
				generation held steady at 273,106 GWh, renewables contributed up to
				95,963 GWh, accounting for 35% of all alternatives.

				The Australian Energy Statistics 2023 report shows that renewable energy
				has reached all-time highs contribution of 35% percentage, nearly 3%
				more than 2022. This achievement reflects Australia's dedication to its
				2030 emissions reduction targets. A key initiative driving this progress
				is the establishment of the National Energy Transformation Partnership,
				which aims to transform Australia's energy system to achieve net zero
				emissions by 2050.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				The state of New South Wales (NSW) also witnesses the same trend, with
				35.6% of total electricity generation coming from renewable sources.
				Additionally, NSW is also leading in overall sustainable energy
				production, generating 25,453 GWh and contributing 25.5% to the national
				total. Followed by Queensland (QLD) and Victoria (VIC), these two major
				states both generated approximately 20,000 GWh of renewable energy.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				In 2019, South Australia (SA) fliped the landscape to join Tasmania
				(TAS) as the only two states that are majorly powered by renewable
				energy. By 2023, SA and TAS are powered by sustainable sources at the
				rates of 74.5% and 98.24%, respectively.

				Renewable energy sources have become increasingly diverse, encompassing
				solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. The top three contributors are solar,
				accounting for 16% of total energy generation, wind at 12%, and hydro at
				6%. Solar remains the predominant source, making up almost half of all
				sustainable options. Additionally, wind energy has shown consistent
				growth, increasing by 16% annually over the last eight years.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				However, the majority of Australia's electricity generation still rely
				on fossil fuel sources including natural gas, oil products, brown coal
				and black coald. These traditional sources contributed up to 177,142 GWh
				(65 per cent) of total electricity generation in 2023, down 3 percentage
				points on 2022. Black coal remains the largest contributor with 93,969
				GWh, which mainly comes from Queensland and New South Wales.
