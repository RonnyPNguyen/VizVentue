				In prior to the Covid-19, the Australian managed fund industry began
				2019 with a strategic emphasis on overseas assets and shares, aiming to
				capitalize on international growth opportunities. This approach paid off
				initially, as evidenced by the increase in total asset values, bolstered
				by strong global markets. However, as global tensions and economic
				uncertainties escalated, the management recognized the need for a more
				conservative strategy, shifting focus towards more stable investments
				like land and buildings.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 forced a drastic
				strategy shift across the entire industry. With markets tumbling and
				investor confidence wavering, the industry increased its holdings in
				liquid assets such as deposits, aiming to safeguard its capital and
				ensure liquidity. This defensive maneuver was crucial as it helped
				stabilize the fund during the peak of market volatility, reflecting a
				prudent response to the global crisis.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				As the world adjusted to post-pandemic realities, Australian managed
				funds experienced a notable recovery in their diversified portfolios.
				This rebound was particularly strong in shares and overseas assets, with
				the latter emerging as the predominant component of the portfolio. The
				shift underscores a significant reallocation, where overseas assets now
				represent the highest percentage of the portfolio, surpassing units in
				trust the first time in 36 years. This highlights the strategic pivot
				towards international markets, reflecting their growing importance and
				potential for higher returns in the economic recovery phase.

				Managed Fund Institutions quarterly growth: steady growth for the

			<p class="copy-content">
				The growth rates of managed funds have shown fluctuations over the eight
				quarters from Q1 2022 to Q4 2023. Each type of institution appears to
				follow a distinct pattern. Most institutions experienced a dip in growth
				rates around the end of 2022 and early 2023, with some recovery or
				further decline in the following quarters.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				Institutions like life insurance corporations and superannuation
				(pension) funds tend to move in similar patterns, indicating a possible
				correlation in their growth rates. These might be driven by similar
				market conditions or regulatory changes affecting both sectors. Public
				offer (retail) unit trusts and friendly societies show more volatile
				changes, suggesting different factors influencing their growth rates
				compared to more traditional managed fund segments.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				The data indicates a variable but somewhat correlated performance among
				different types of managed funds, with noticeable periodic dips and
				recoveries. This behavior suggests responsiveness to overarching
				economic conditions, which could be further analyzed for specific causal
				factors.
