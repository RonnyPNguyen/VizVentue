			<h1>The Rising Living Cost for Australians</h1>
			<h4>(Latest of Q1 2024)</h4>
			<br />
			<h2 class="sub-heading">
				Inflation has taken a big hit on cost of living for millions of
				Australians. The Q1 2024 data shows a 3.6% increase in the consumer
				price index, making the inflation rate higher than its target band for
				more than 2 years.

			<p class="copy-content">
				The cost of living in Australia, has been increasing due to inflation
				with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing a rise of 3.6% in the 12
				months to May 2024. Major sectors contributing to this increase include
				housing, food & non-alcoholic beverages, and transport.

			<p class="copy-content">
				Housing and transportation took the biggest hit during Covid 19 pandemic
				but over the past five years, these sectors have surged by more than
				22%, leading the price escalations trend. The crisis has taken toll on
				the Aussie household on both material and psychological hardship. On the
				brighter note, Clothing and footwear remain reasonably priced, picking
				up only 5% over the same period.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				The aggregate CPI has accumulated a surge of 20.4% while the median wage
				rate (WPI) has only increased by 14.5% over the 5 year period. This
				alarming gap has necessitated policymakers respond to maintain citizens'
				living standards. In reality, a A$3.5 billion cost of living package has
				been deployed for energy rebate and rental assistance in the most recent
				federal budget.

				Is Sydney the most expensive city to live in Australia?

			<p class="copy-content">
				The largest KFC franchise has recently report peak sales amid staggering
				economy, suggesting that Aussie are preferring fast food over restaurant
				dinning for cost-cutting. Consumers are reported to feel the pinch of
				higher interest rate and inflation. A further investigation into other
				living aspects such as rent, groceries, restaurant, and purchasing power
				is conducted among 9 biggest cities in Oceania region.

				Sydney, NSW, only ranks third in cost of living trailing Canberra and
				Adelaide. On the other side of the spectrum, Brisbane, QLD, and
				Melbourne, VIC, are more affordable than other cities on the list.
				However, Sydney claims the top spot in rent index, and rent-included
				cost of living index. Indeed, it becomes the most expensive city to live
				in Australia in aggregate.
			</p>
			<p class="copy-content">
				Despite the high cost of living, groceries and dinning prices have
				soften the blow for Sydneysiders, leaving an appeal for tourism. The
				balance between high living costs and manageable everyday expenses
				creates a unique economic landscape for the Harbour City, influencing
				both local life and tourism positively.
